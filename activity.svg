Of course, as in Google Summer of Code put it - they give equal opportunity to people - the same students for the same work done in different countries would receive ~1K in Somalia, &amp; 5K in Switzerland. Indeed that is equal encouragement &amp; opportunity. Since smart people can't exist/survive in Somalia, since if they educated themselves smart enough to work in GHC - as my friends told - people with higher education, the kind of polite smart people - are considered by military regimes a too valuable commodity to give up during the regime change &amp; overall get considered a hazard to local military rulers. So friends told that on return to homeland they would be killed since they received higher education, a father of one of them, electrician, manages to not get killed, because the local rulers need electricity.
I know that the argument of the multiplication of a person's life on "The Economic Power Index of the country" works great on paper. Indeed people who managed to keep high morals &amp; stay good people in Somalia, do not need money or help or encouragement.

Depending on my GPS location - I get drastically different salaries &amp; work offers (in fact living here I get no offers at all, only automatic replies). I would uncover a secret, in Ukraine median salary is ~4323.6$. It is a year. Because, depending on the motivation, I'm not fancy &amp; I can't get work (except rare invitations to do cryptocurrencies, which I begin to consider), I can survive here on those 360$ a month &amp; would be ready to go damping that low, because I have high morals &amp; disregard money reasoning. In addition to what is requested in the requirements I would also have the knowledge of Haskell tooling, and happen to Haskell on some level, so I guess that can be used as a starting point &amp; people while live in Ukraine probably deserve it. But wait, there are countries where is an even cheaper workforce, so even those 360$/m can be saved depending on the geographic locations. There is a lot of economies that are worse than in Ukraine, where people live even in more peculiar situations.

I guess these are true facts nevertheless. If work is marked fully remote, at least do not advertise to a person that how much a person would earn for the same fully remote work depends on GPS location, because you would divert good specialists in poor countries &amp; encourage people in rich countries to apply because of money. That is an organization's internal considerations and level of experience &amp; bargaining the salary exists for it. The normal salary bargaining happens in the normal conditions. It is Ok to ask for "raw expectations" during interviews &amp; establish the salary. Also probably it is better to not tell the maximum sum - because ... there seem to be no good logical paths of good outcomes from that. If the person would cost all $124K - you probably know that person &amp; if they are interested - they would probably 1. be noticed on application 2. and would ask "how much HF got" in the chatroom or in the interview, if they need that much money.
In any situation: "The position was evaluated $124k, but I was chosen as the best candidate &amp; highered at 48k" - that fact stays in the back of the head of the person during work, demotivating a person or can start processes of internal reasoning, in a long term that can play a role between during hard moments of high complexity tasts, high demand in work &amp; overtimes - the person being motivated or not, if the person would know that position was $124k, but they do work for X$ - it can demotivate the person.
I suggest only the gradual Newtonian method of ballparking around the normal distribution deviation. People in capitalism seem to forget how to bargain. I still remember why the tradition of bargain existed, in childhood, it told me that character &amp; people communication &amp; people values worth more than prices, which frequently have a high degree of arbitrary.
I love honesty &amp; mainly prefer it. But I am not monadic to honesty. Sometimes it is easier to pretend you do not know, or ascent to the level of to not care about what other people do/how they live, than to live, explicitly see &amp;, live through it &amp; feel it every day while you can't change it really for you, only you for future generations or society as a whole can change.
So, as a poor person from a poor country - I would ask to remove the mentioning that salary depends on "geographical location". And the upper bound of salary always seemed illogical to me, if you want to select people - set the minimal salary - that would show to applicants how much serious person needs to be to the requirements, the people that want too much to their level - is in itself a redflag to the quality of the person. The former one (country) - both parties know &amp; it is a Polichinelle secret, the second one (max boundary) is illogical to mention, people anyway should not apply for profit reasons into nonprofit organizations, I think Haskell Foundation can find a DevOps for a reasonable cost without mentioning the upper bound.</div>
